If that’s you, the <a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/ngram-tools">ngrams</a> command-line tool is something you can use to compare n-grams within books to see if small portions of any two (English) books overlap.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is this: if two books (or authors) were inspired by a common source, or if one book (or author) was inspired by the other, then there is likely to be some unusual words or phrases that “stand out,” statistically speaking.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/ngram-tools">ngrams</a> tool is a <em>very fast</em> implementation of an ngram counter. It’s written using the Rust programming language, which is known as one of the fastest, safest languages in today’s language ecosystem. It takes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ascii</a> encoded text as input, cleans it up, iterates over windows of size N (for whatever value of N you want—e.g. 4 is a reasonable window size), and then counts the N-grams.</p>\n<p>Then, using <code class="language-text">client / server mode</code> you can query for n-grams that match between two or more books.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious, this tool is similar to the <a href="using-textgrams-jl">TextGrams.jl</a> tool we previously published, but uses less memory and therefore can load a larger baseline into memory on a single machine.</p>\n<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/ngram-tools">ngram-tools</a> github page for usage details.</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/n-gram/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Fast N-gram Tool",tags:["n-gram"],date:"2019-07-25T19:00:00Z",description:"We've built some fast rust-based n-gram research tools for the Mac OS, Linux, or Windows command line."}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/ngram-tools"}}}});
