We study the relationships between books, with a special focus on The Book of Mormon and other religious texts. We are a small volunteer organization with members across the United States and Canada who are curious about the origins of the Book of Mormon and want to contribute to its study.

### [BomDB](https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb)
A resource for computer-aided studies of the Book of Mormon. Contains a command-line tool (Linux/MacOS/Windows) that can be used to find specific verses across multiple editions, or produce full copies (with our without chapter/verse annotations) of each edition.
