![books](./books.jpg)

We study the relationships between books, with a special focus on The Book of Mormon and other religious texts. We are a small volunteer organization with members across the United States and Canada who are curious about the origins of the Book of Mormon and want to contribute to its study.

## Projects

### [Book of Mormon Origins](https://www.bookofmormonorigins.com)

An open-source, public domain resource that adds missing footnotes to the Book of Mormon.

### [The Late War Study](http://wordtree.org/thelatewar)

A computer-aided study that reveals some remarkable similarities between the Book of Mormon and The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain (published in 1816).

### [BomDB](https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb)

A resource for computer-aided studies of the Book of Mormon. Contains a command-line tool (Linux/MacOS/Windows) that can be used to find specific verses across multiple editions, or produce full copies (with our without chapter/verse annotations) of each edition.
