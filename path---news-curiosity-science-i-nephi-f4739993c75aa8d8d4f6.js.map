Finally, in those subfolders, you’ll find <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.md</code> files that are text files containing the actual book contents.</p>\\n<p>Since these books are raw OCR conversions of scanned pages, the quality of the text varies quite a bit.

What if there were 19th century books that are even more similar to the “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents…” phrase? Could we search for that? Here’s an advanced regular expression that looks for the word “I”, followed by a comma, and then a capitalized word (e.g. name), followed by the words “born” and “parent(s)” in any of the next two lines:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ grep -A2 -Er &#39;\\\\bI,[\\\\s]+[A-Z][a-z][a-z]&#39; library/ \\\\\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;born&#39; \\\\\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;parent&#39;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Again, quite a few matches!

We’re clearly dealing with noisy data—yup, looks like archive.org mis-dated an edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica as written in 1768, when in actuality it was written after 1830.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, we can see a lot of references to Nephi here. Some of them are from the Bible… wait, the bible? It turns out Maccabees contains a reference to a place called Nephi, and many bibles back then used to contain the Apocrypha.</p>\\n<p>What if we want to search for the pattern that Book of Mormon Central is talking about, though—something like “I, [so-and-so], (son or daughter) of [so-and-so]…“?</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ grep -A2 -E &#39;\\\\bI\\\\s?,[\\\\s]+[A-Z][a-z][a-z]&#39; library/ \\\\\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -Ei &#39;\\\\b(son|daughter) of&#39;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is a more advanced regular expression, and since this is more about tools, if you’d like to understand regexps better, I’ll just point you to a good <a href=\\\"https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html\\\">tutorial</a>.</p>\\n<p>This search yields some interesting results, more than 100 matches, some of which I’ll highlight:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“This is the account of what I, Ibrahim, the son of Candu the merchant, have seen ; this is what I have been present at, and a witness to: where is the Malay who has seen the like that I, Ibrahim, the son of Candu, have seen since I arrived in the great country of Bengal!!”\\n<br><a href=\\\"https://archive.org/details/jouralofresidenc00mari/page/196\\\">Journal of a Residence in India, 1812</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“I, Cennino, son of Andrea Cennini born in the Colle di Valdelsa, was instructed in these arts by Agnolo, son of Taddeo of Florence, my master, who learned the art from Taddeo, his father, the godson of Giotto, whose disciple he had been for twenty-four years.”\\n<br><a href=\\\"https://archive.org/details/quarterlyreview15protgoog/page/n94\\\">The Quarterly Review, London, 1845</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“I, Charlotte K.

What if there were 19th century books that are even more similar to the “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents…” phrase? Could we search for that? Here’s an advanced regular expression that looks for the word “I”, followed by a comma, and then a capitalized word (e.g. name), followed by the words “born” and “parent(s)” in any of the next two lines:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">$ grep -A2 -Er &#39;\\\\bI,[\\\\s]+[A-Z][a-z][a-z]&#39; library/ \\\\\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;born&#39; \\\\\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;parent&#39;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Again, quite a few matches! Here are two interesting ones:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“I, John Barnard was born at Boston, 6th Nov. 1681; descended from reputable parents, viz.
