In particular, we’ve highlighted 3 of the things we’ve done that we think might be useful to you:</p>\n<div style="padding-left: 4.5em">\n<h3><a href="https://www.bookofmormonorigins.com">Book of Mormon Origins</a></h3>\n<p>An open-source, public domain resource that adds missing footnotes to the Book of Mormon.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://wordtreefoundation.github.io/thelatewar/">The Late War Study</a></h3>\n<p>A computer-aided study that reveals some remarkable similarities between the Book of Mormon and The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain (published in 1816).</p>\n<h3><a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb">BomDB</a></h3>\n<p>A resource for computer-aided studies of the Book of Mormon. Contains a command-line tool (Linux/MacOS/Windows) that can be used to find specific verses across multiple editions, or produce full copies (with our without chapter/verse annotations) of each edition.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Second, we’re changing the site around so that the blog is not the only thing visible. We’ll be working on providing APIs, data, and new and interesting information about the Book of Mormon. We’ll highlight some of these as they become ready.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/website/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Site Update",tags:["website"],date:"2018-03-04T19:59:15Z",description:"After 3 years of quietude, we've updated the website to make it easier for you to see what WordTree is working on, to find what you're looking for, and to contribute to projects you find interesting."}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/site-update"}}}});
