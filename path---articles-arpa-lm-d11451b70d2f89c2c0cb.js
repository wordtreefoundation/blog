In the past, we’ve shown raw unconditional probabilities to be an interesting (albeit limited) way of scoring similarities among books. Our online publication of <a href="http://wordtreefoundation.github.io/thelatewar/">A Comparison of The Book of Mormon and The Late War</a> was the result of that original research.</p>\n<p>I started off today thinking I’d be able to transform the <a href="https://github.com/canadaduane/TextGrams.jl">previous n-gram library</a> we wrote in the Julia programming language over to KenLM, a very fast Language Model generator. Instead, I ended up spending most of the day learning about language models and data formats. I thought I’d pass along some of this information and any insights I’ve had.</p>\n<p>First, a Language Model is far better than the pure N-gram (unconditional) probabilities we’ve been using at the WordTree Foundation up to this point. In particular, language models have a notion of <em>conditional probability</em> which makes assessing probabilities of word occurrences in a text more accurate.</p>\n<p>When I take a text like the Book of Mormon and pass it through <a href="https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/">KenLM</a>’s “lmplz” processor, it generates a file called an ARPA file. The ARPA file format looks like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code class="language-none">\\data\\\nngram 1=5776\nngram 2=55566\n\n\\1-grams:\n-4.7039757 <unk> 0\n0 <s> -1.505814\n-4.554822 </s> 0\n-1.7441652 the -1.075229\n-2.4278247 book -1.6445116\n-1.6198214 of -1.2298658\n-3.932976 mormon -0.52456135\n-1.452003 . -4.009832\n-2.7216232 an -0.6389431\n-3.7242882 account -0.75844955\n…\n\n\\2-grams:\n-0.000042455064 . </s>\n-1.9652246 <s> the\n-0.5145896 of the\n-1.5662498 mormon the\n-1.7051648 written the\n-0.30002946 by the\n-1.6727574 hand the\n-0.429893 upon the\n-2.2684872 plates the\n-1.6545775 taken the\n-0.3712691 from the\n…\n\n\\end\\</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>It wasn’t obvious to me at first what these negative numbers were. It turns out they are <em>log probabilities</em> in base 10. In other words, rather than saying “the chance of seeing ‘the’ is 0.018023”, the ARPA format uses <code>-1.7441652</code> which means take “10” and raise it to the power of “-1.7441652” to get the probability (i.e. 0.018023). This form of representation for probabilities is usually more compact because probabilities can get very small (e.g. rather than writing “0.000000478630092” we can just write <code>-6.32</code>). In addition, as a <em>log</em> value, they naturally represent order of magnitude more prominently.</p>\n<p>In an ARPA file, the unigrams (1-grams) are <em>unconditional probabilities</em> while the N-grams with N of 2 or larger are <em>conditional probabilities</em>. In other words, when we see “-1.7441652 the” in the 1-grams section, it is simply the log probability that the word <code>the</code> will show up in the language, i.e. in mathematical notation, <strong>P</strong>(<em>the</em>), or “Probability of <code>the</code>”. But in the 2-grams section, when we see “-0.5145896 of the”, this is the probability that <code>the</code> will show up after <code>of</code>, i.e. in mathematical notation, <strong>P</strong>(<em>the</em>|<em>of</em>), or “Probability of <code>the</code> given <code>of</code>”.</p>\n<p>There are three “special” words in a language model: <strong>&#x3C;s></strong>, <strong>&#x3C;/s></strong>, and <strong>&#x3C;unk></strong>. The <strong>&#x3C;s></strong> denotes the beginning of a sentence, and the <strong>&#x3C;/s></strong> denotes the end of a sentence. This differs from our original study where we had no concept of beginnings and ends of sentences—we just ignored sentence boundaries. The <strong>&#x3C;unk></strong> special word means “unknown” and is used in the language model to represent the probability of a word not in the model (I believe this is also known as “out of vocabulary” or OOV).</p>\n<p>By using conditional probabilities, queries for phrases will result in probabilities that more accurately reflect the frequency or rarity of that phrase. Ultimately, this will lead to a more accurate scoring algorithm when comparing books and trying to uncover non-obvious relationships or influences among texts.</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/n-gram/","/tags/book-of-mormon/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Understanding ARPA and Language Models",tags:["n-gram","book-of-mormon"],date:"2014-01-11T19:00:00.000Z",description:"I started off today thinking I’d be able to transform a previous n-gram library we wrote in the Julia programming language over to KenLM, a very fast Language Model generator.
