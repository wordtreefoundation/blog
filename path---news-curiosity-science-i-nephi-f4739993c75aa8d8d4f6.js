There isn’t anything wrong with it if you just want reasons to believe the Book of Mormon is holy.</p>\n<p>One of the beautiful things about truth is that it is strengthened by inspection from multiple perspectives. Curiosity and a thirst for truth drives us to experiment with ideas, and with the powerful tools we have today, we can often investigate literary hypotheses ourselves.</p>\n<h2>Another Hypothesis?</h2>\n<p>Let’s say you have another hypothesis: that maybe the Book of Mormon was written in the 19th century, rather than miraculously translated from an ancient source. Your curiosity drives you to want to see deeply into this, and you’re looking for tools. How would you go about testing this?</p>\n<p>If the Book of Mormon were written in the 1800s, we might expect to see other books from its time with similar phrasing. Maybe “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents…” is a <a href="https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series">remix</a> of language and ideas from the 1800s?</p>\n<p>Let’s look at elements of the faithful interpretation and see if we can construct an alternative hypothesis worthy of testing:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>“I, Nephi” Faithful Hypothesis</th>\n<th>“I, Nephi” Alt. Hypothesis</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1. Nephi used style of ancient kings</td>\n<td> \nJoseph used style of 19th C. writers?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2.

Did 19th century writers write this way?</p>\n<h3>19th century authors wrote with “I, [name], son of…” phrase?</h3>\n<p>Rather than Nephi using the “I, [name], son of [name]” terminology from ancient kings, could Joseph have read this in 19th century books? Did they write that way back then?</p>\n<h3>19th century autobiography style resonates?</h3>\n<p>Rather than Nephi using an autobiographical style that includes a record of things “in his day”, could Joseph have written something like this in the 19th century? Did autobiographical texts talk about parentage, education, and religious standing?</p>\n<h3>19th century authors mention both parents?</h3>\n<p>Rather than Nephi deviating from the pattern of Kings mentioning fathers, could Joseph have taken inspiration from 19th century authors to mention parents in the plural? Did anyone in the 19th century attribute good to both parents?</p>\n<h2>Getting the Data</h2>\n<p>We can get a lot of data from archive.org, which has meticulously gathered, scanned, and OCRed centuries-old books. Using <a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb">archdown</a> you could download all of these books in a nice text format with header info.</p>\n<p>Or, you could use our English Books archive, which is a handy copy of archive.org’s 1650 to 1829 books: download <a href="http://data.wordtree.org/archive-org-english-books-1650-1829-asof-2019-06-24.tar.gz">pre-1830 Books from Archive.org</a> as a <code class="language-text">.tar.gz</code> zip file (~30 GB of data, ~137 GB uncompressed).</p>\n<p>Once you have the data, unzip the archive:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ gunzip http://data.wordtree.org/archive-org-english-books-1650-1829-asof-2019-06-24.tar.gz</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>It will create a <code class="language-text">library/</code> folder in the directory you unzip it into. That <code class="language-text">library/</code> folder will contain many two-letter subfolders, each containing two-letter subfolders themselves. Finally, in those subfolders, you’ll find <code class="language-text">.md</code> files that are text files containing the actual book contents.</p>\n<p>Since these books are raw OCR conversions of scanned pages, the quality of the text varies quite a bit. The quality is sufficient that we can still test our hypothesis, however.</p>\n<p>You can now search 137 GB of text, all from books written prior to the Book of Mormon’s publication date!</p>\n<h2>Experimenting with Unix Tools</h2>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the <code class="language-text">grep</code> command-line utility, and regular expressions, you can search precisely for any pattern you’d like. For example, let’s search the library for Nephi:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ grep -r &#39;Nephi&#39; library/</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Some example matches:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">Sor, Tyrus, metropolis Phoenices, in tribu Nephihalim, Et Theo-\n^K ^arthia, which had formed king ufThehesby Nephile; who with\n1&#39;ratt Nephi.

This search yielded 734 results in about 5 minutes of searching on my PC (having an SSD hard drive helps).</p>\n<p>A lot of the results are infix matches—“Nephi” is part of “Nephilim” and “Mount Nephin” for example. Can we tighten the search up so it doesn’t show these?</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ grep -Er &#39;\\bNephi\\b&#39; library/</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So now we’re using a more advanced regular expression, with the <code class="language-text">\\b</code> word-boundary marker. This ensures that any match of “Nephi” will be just Nephi, and not Nephilim, for example. With this addition, we reduce the results to 102 matches!</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">along the mountain base from&#39;Nephi to Willard.\nNephi,\n1&#39;ratt Nephi.

It looks like a reference to the Book of Mormon is in there. Well, that can’t be right. We’re clearly dealing with noisy data—yup, looks like archive.org mis-dated an edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica as written in 1768, when in actuality it was written after 1830.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we can see a lot of references to Nephi here. Some of them are from the Bible… wait, the bible? It turns out Maccabees contains a reference to a place called Nephi, and many bibles back then used to contain the Apocrypha.</p>\n<p>What if we want to search for the pattern that Book of Mormon Central is talking about, though—something like “I, [so-and-so], (son or daughter) of [so-and-so]…“?</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ grep -A2 -E &#39;\\bI\\s?,[\\s]+[A-Z][a-z][a-z]&#39; library/ \\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -Ei &#39;\\b(son|daughter) of&#39;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is a more advanced regular expression, and since this is more about tools, if you’d like to understand regexps better, I’ll just point you to a good <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p>This search yields some interesting results, more than 100 matches, some of which I’ll highlight:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This is the account of what I, Ibrahim, the son of Candu the merchant, have seen ; this is what I have been present at, and a witness to: where is the Malay who has seen the like that I, Ibrahim, the son of Candu, have seen since I arrived in the great country of Bengal!!”\n<br><a href="https://archive.org/details/jouralofresidenc00mari/page/196">Journal of a Residence in India, 1812</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I, Cennino, son of Andrea Cennini born in the Colle di Valdelsa, was instructed in these arts by Agnolo, son of Taddeo of Florence, my master, who learned the art from Taddeo, his father, the godson of Giotto, whose disciple he had been for twenty-four years.”\n<br><a href="https://archive.org/details/quarterlyreview15protgoog/page/n94">The Quarterly Review, London, 1845</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I, Charlotte K.

What if there were 19th century books that are even more similar to the “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents…” phrase? Could we search for that? Here’s an advanced regular expression that looks for the word “I”, followed by a comma, and then a capitalized word (e.g. name), followed by the words “born” and “parent(s)” in any of the next two lines:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ grep -A2 -Er &#39;\\bI,[\\s]+[A-Z][a-z][a-z]&#39; library/ \\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;born&#39; \\\n  | grep -B2 -A2 -i &#39;parent&#39;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Again, quite a few matches! Here are two interesting ones:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I, John Barnard was born at Boston, 6th Nov. 1681; descended from reputable parents, viz.
